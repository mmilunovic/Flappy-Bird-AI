# Flappy-Bird-AI
AI that teaches itself to play flappy bird game

Simple AI that teashes itself to play flappy bird, this project was part of artificial intelligence course.

The AI uses basic genetic algorithm there every specie has its neural network which helps it to learn how to move.
Neural network consists of 4 input neurons (Birds X and Y coordinate and X and Y coordinate of a wall) one layer of 4 hidden neurons and one layer of 3 hidden neurons.
